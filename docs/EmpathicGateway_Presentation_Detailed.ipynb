    "Customer support systems are often \"First-In, First-Out\" (FIFO). This means:\n",
    "*   A user whose **wallet was stolen** waits in line behind 500 users asking **\"How do I change my avatar?\"**.\n",

    "1.  **Understands Urgency:** Prioritizes Critical requests instantly.\n",
    "2.  **Protects Privacy:** Redacts PII before it leaves the edge.\n",
